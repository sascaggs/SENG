<p>You can always tell when an article about networks is about to get formal. It usually happens just after the background, when the author writes, “Let <span class="math inline">\(N = \{1,2,...n\}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> is…” What does all this notation mean and why do we needed? In this post, I’ll tell you.</p>
<div id="notation" class="section level1">
<h1>Notation</h1>
<p>Notation is not that different from language. In fact, some talk about mathematical or scientific notation as a kind of language. The languages we speak everyday are dynamic; the meaning of words changes and is repurposed to fit different situations. Like everyday language, notation has a grammar and a syntax. The main difference is thatthe syntactic and semantic rules that govern how the notation is used is strict and hardly, if ever, changes to fit specific situations.</p>
<p>The purpose of notation is similar to language; to give users a collective basin of meaning which can be used to communication effectively. Because of the dynamism of language, it is not uncommon for two people to miscommunicate during a conversation, requiring them to navigate their way back to a collective understanding. The strict rules of notation exist to help us to avoid this detour. This enables scientists to communicate a great deal of complex information in a compact way. If each symbol or sentence in notation required a shared justification of meaning, it would be impossible to write proofs and equations the way we do today.</p>
<p>A network graph is represented by <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, and a subset of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> – a connected component or clique – is represented by <span class="math inline">\(g&#39;\)</span>.</p>
