<p>Once a month, the <a href="https://epn.osu.edu/getting-started">Environmental Professionals Network</a> (EPN) hosts network events over breakfast. The EPN is a service of the School of Environment and Natural Resources at Ohio State University that works to help connect and grow environmental professionals both in-person and online.</p>
<p>This month’s EPN event focuses on “<a href="https://epn.osu.edu/events/epn-breakfast-september-13-2022-advancing-environmental-justice-extreme-heat-and-adapting">Advancing environmental justice in extreme head and adapting through collaborative networks</a>.” As part of this September 13th event, SENG members Kimberly Ordonez and Harrison Fried will present their work developing a “Network of Stakeholders” website tool that harnesses the power of network science to help bring together environmentally focused organizations and individuals.</p>
