The Social Ecological Networks Group (SENG) is graduate student led working group that uses the network concept to think about and study social and ecological processes. The overall goal of SENG is to provide a space to collaborate and develop radical new ideas about complex social ecological networks. 

**We are happy you found us**. After all, this is a group about networks, and networks are formed through interactions like the ones that led here. But networks are much more than these direct interactions because they exhibit patterns and behavior that change depending on the scale that you look at them from. Network patterns can be found in all kinds of social and ecological systems, and the patterns they take provide clues about how systems function, what their histories might have been like, and what to expect in the future. 

At SENG, we hold regular meetings where we can openly discuss these complex network dynamics. In these meetings, we focus on **network theory** -- the concepts and ideas that we can use to apply a network perspective and conduct network science. But as you likely know, science is more than ideas; it is a practice. At SENG, we also hold meetings dedicated understanding **network analysis**, where we can learn to construct and analyze networks together as a casual learning community. 

If any of this sounds interesting to you, [send us an email](https://seng.netlify.app/contact/) and get involved with SENG. If you'd like to learn more about how SENG is structured and what our short and long term goals are, have a look at our first post, [What is SENG?](https://seng.netlify.app/2021/01/11/what-is-seng/)
