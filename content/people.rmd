### Harrison Fried 

I am a graduate research fellow in the School of Environment and Natural Resources at The Ohio State University and I am interested in how people manage ecological processes. My masterâ€™s research, which is advised by [Dr. Ramiro Berardo](http://www.ramiroberardo.net/) and [Dr. Matthew Hamilton](https://senr.osu.edu/our-people/matthew-hamilton), focuses on a social-ecological network depicting climate change adaptation in Ohio. The guiding question of my research is to determine under what conditions environmental stakeholders manage for ecological interdependencies. My research interests in local environmental protection are heavily shaped by my undergraduate thesis experience, in which I studied how human-induced environmental stressors impact fish in Lake Erie.

### Shane A. Scaggs

I am a PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology at the Ohio State University where I work in the [Human Complexity Lab](http://u.osu.edu/hclab/). I am generally interested in how humans directly and indirectly shape ecosystems and the feedbacks between social and ecological processes. My dissertation research focuses on how Q'eqchi' Maya foragers and horticulturalists interact with tropical food webs and forest landscapes in southern Belize where I have conducted fieldwork with my adviser, [Dr. Sean Downey](https://anthropology.osu.edu/people/downey.205). In my master's research with [Dr. Drew Gerkey](https://liberalarts.oregonstate.edu/users/drew-gerkey), I conducted fieldwork with the [Division of Subsistence](https://www.adfg.alaska.gov/index.cfm?adfg=subsistence.main), a branch of the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, and used network modeling to characterize the relationship between subsistence harvest diversity and resource sharing in a network of rural Alaskan households.
