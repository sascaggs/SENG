### Shane A. Scaggs

I am a PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology at the Ohio State University where I work in the [Human Complexity Lab](http://u.osu.edu/hclab/). I am generally interested in how humans, as a strongly interacting species, directly and indirectly shape ecosystems. My dissertation research focuses on the role of Q'eqchi' Maya foragers and horticulturalists in the ecological and social networks of southern Belize where I have conducted fieldwork with my adviser, [Dr. Sean Downey](https://anthropology.osu.edu/people/downey.205). In my master's research, I conducted fieldwork with the Division of Subsistence, a branch of the Alaska Department of Fish & Game, and used network modeling to characterize the relationship between subsistence harvest diversity and resource sharing in a network of rural Alaskan households.
