## Meeting Information 

Welcome back network folx! 

This semester, we will have 7 meetings. Something new we are doing this semester are *Informal Workshops*. In these workshops, we will meet in person to discuss our projects and work together to solve some of our analysis challenges. You can think of these workshops as a time to drop-in, say hello, and work collectively on our individual projects. We will keep a zoom room open as well so that our non-Columbus members can stop in and ask questions. 

- **Time**: 3PM Eastern Standard Time
- **Dates**: 1/27, 2/10, 2/24, 3/10, 3/24, 4/14, 4/28
