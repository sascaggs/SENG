<h3>Shane A. Scaggs</h3>
<p>I am a PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology at the Ohio State University. I am generally interested in how humans, as a strongly interacting species, directly and indirectly shape trophic networks. My dissertation research focuses on Q’eqchi’ Maya foragers and horticulturalists in the ecological and social networks of southern Belize where I have conducted fieldwork with my adviser, <a href="https://anthropology.osu.edu/people/downey.205">Dr. Sean Downey</a>. In my master’s research, I conducted fieldwork with the Division of Subsistence, a branch of the Alaska Department of Fish &amp; Game, and used network modeling to characterize the relationship between subsistence harvest diversity and resource sharing.</p>
