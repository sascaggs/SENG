      <description>PreambleIn this post, I will demonstrate how to use tools from the statnet collection of packages to simulate and model networks. The purpose of this post is to provide readers with tools that I wish I had when I first started using network analysis. I’m not an expert and I’m still learning how to use these tools well. But knowing they exist and how to use them will enable you to creatively study network processes and validate your prior knowledge of and conclusions about the networks that you study.</description>

      <description>Module 1: R Studio BasicsR is both a language and computing environment.R is open source and free for anyone to download and use.
PanelsThere are four visible panels at a time, each with different purposes(1) The R console accepts commands and produces output to your commands.(2) A text editor window to create and record code.(3) An environment window that shows your stored data in R(4) A plot/help/files window that can alternate to show your plots, help reauests, and file directory</description>

      <description>Data StructuresThe Square MatrixThe EdgelistBut Why?Bernouli Graph SimulationNetwork objects in igraphMatrix \(\rightarrow\) networkEdgelist \(\rightarrow\) networkVisualize igraph objectsNetwork objects in statnetVisualize network objectsReferencesIn this meeting, we cover the basics of working with networks in R. By the end of the workshop, you will be acquainted with three packages – igraph, statnet, and tidygraph – and you will be able to create a network from scratch, turn it into a network object, create vertex and edge attributes, and genereate a basic visualization.</description>

      <title>Foundations of the Network Perspective</title>

      <description>Discussion ITo start our discussion, let’s to reflect on our current understandings of a network as a concept. In small groups, take a moment to discuss the following questions.
What is a network?
How would you describe a network in simple terms?
In our view, a network is a representation of a set(s) of relationships between one or more entities. The entities of interest to the SENG are usually social or ecological beings.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Social Ecological Networks Group. For brevity, we use SENG (sen-jee) as a mnemonic that you’ll find throughout this website and our social media handles. SENG is a graduate student led working group that uses the network concept to think about and study social and ecological processes. You can learn more about us and our research interests by checking out the People tab.
We were motivated to create SENG for numerous reasons.</description>

      <description>The Social Ecological Networks Group (SENG) is graduate student led learning collective that uses the network concept to think about and study social and ecological problems. Our goal is to provide a space to collaborate and develop new ideas about complex social ecological networks.
We are happy you found us.
After all, this is a group about networks, and networks are formed through interactions just like the ones that led you here.</description>

I am a PhD candidate and NSF Graduate Research Fellow in the Department of Anthropology at the Ohio State University where I work in the Human Complexity Lab. My research focuses on the social and ecological dynamics of human subsistence activities (e.g., cultivation, foraging, exchange). I am conducting my dissertation research in southern Belize, where I have previous conducted fieldwork with my advisor, Sean Downey.</description>
