      <description>Meeting InformationWelcome back network folx!
This semester, we will have 7 meetings. Something new we are doing this semester are Informal Workshops. In these workshops, we will meet in person to discuss our projects and work together to solve some of our analysis challenges. You can think of these workshops as a time to drop-in, say hello, and work collectively on our individual projects. We will keep a zoom room open as well so that our non-Columbus members can stop in and ask questions.</description>

      <title>An introduction to community detection and network motifs</title>

      <description>In this post, I will focus on two topics: community detection and subgraph motifs. In previous posts, we have discussed some basic methods for describing network structure. We used these methods to either describe the positioning of individual nodes (e.g., centrality metrics) or some global properties of a network (e.g., connectivity, average path length). Now we will focus on subgraph patterns that transcend the scale of individuals or dyads but nevertheless reside within a global network of interest.</description>

      <description>IntroductionWe have already discussed a lot about Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs) in the first tutorial. However, there’s much more to learn! Many times, researchers would like to run ERGMs for network datasets that are not binary, and determine how complex variables influence the probability of a network connection. For example, additional methods exist for using ERGMs with networks that have bipartite (two-mode) data and longitudinal (dynamic networks across time) data.</description>

      <description>PreambleWe’ve talked about ERGMs but we really only covered binary ERGMs. Not too long ago, binary ERGMs were all that was available to us in R, something that anthropologist David Nolin noted in a 2010 paper on food sharing in Human Nature:
“The chief disadvantage of ERGM is that dependent-variable networks can consist only of binary ties… Networks composed of valued ties can be binarized for use with ERGM, but this entails a loss of statistical information.</description>

      <title>Exponential Random Graph Models, An Introduction</title>

      <description>IntroductionWe can a learn a lot about a network using visualization tools and descriptive statistics. But many researchers would like to make inferences about how specific variables influence the probability of a network connection. There are multiple ways to do this – latent network modeling, multilevel Bayesian models, quadratic assignment procedures – but one of the most common and versatile methods is to build Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs).</description>

      <title>(Re)Introduction to Networks in R</title>

      <guid>https://seng.netlify.app/meetings/re-introduction-to-networks-in-r/</guid>
      <description>In this meeting, we cover the basics of working with networks in R. By the end of the workshop, you will be acquainted with three packages – igraph, statnet, and tidygraph – and you will be able to create a network from scratch, turn it into a network object, create vertex and edge attributes, and genereate a basic visualization. Let’s get started.
R Markdown IntroductionBefore we begin talking about networks, let’s first talk about the R studio environment.</description>

      <title>Measures of network position and structure </title>
      <link>https://seng.netlify.app/2022/09/30/measures-of-network-position-and-structure/</link>

      <description>Many networks that we find interesting are large and structurally complex. This makes them difficult to visually understand. And although coming up with ways to visualize such networks is a kind of fun, most of the time we need practical ways to describe the position and structure of complex networks without dealing with the tangled hairball.
This post covers some a variety of ways to measure network position and structure.</description>

      <description>Once a month, the Environmental Professionals Network (EPN) hosts network events over breakfast. The EPN is a service of the School of Environment and Natural Resources at Ohio State University that works to help connect and grow environmental professionals both in-person and online.
This month’s EPN event focuses on “Advancing environmental justice in extreme head and adapting through collaborative networks.” As part of this September 13th event, SENG members Kimberly Ordonez and Harrison Fried will present their work developing a “Network of Stakeholders” website tool that harnesses the power of network science to help bring together environmentally focused organizations and individuals.</description>

      <title>Egocentric patterns in homophilous networks</title>
      <link>https://seng.netlify.app/meetings/complete-and-egocentric-networks/</link>

      <guid>https://seng.netlify.app/meetings/complete-and-egocentric-networks/</guid>
      <description>Introduction Researchers who work with smaller populations that have clearly defined boundaries (Laumann, Marsden, and Prensky 1989) may be able to design survey instruments that can feasibly document an entire social network. These complete, sociocentric networks can exhibit some systematic biases (Ready et al. 2020), but they typically do a better job of characterizing the full suite of direct and indirect connections within a population.
Many researchers, however, work in larger populations that have fuzzy boundaries, if any.</description>

      <title>Network size and structure</title>
      <link>https://seng.netlify.app/2021/12/22/size-structure-and-density/</link>

      <guid>https://seng.netlify.app/2021/12/22/size-structure-and-density/</guid>
      <description>The size of a network is determined by the number of vertices and edges within it, and different size networks have different structural properties. This is obviously true if social processes like homophily, preferential attachment, or triadic closure influence network size, but it is also true for randomly generated networks.
How do properties like density, sparseness, degree distribution, or connectivity change as the number of vertices in a network increases?</description>

      <title>Network Simulation using {statnet}</title>

      <guid>https://seng.netlify.app/meetings/introduction-to-network-simulation-with-statnet/</guid>
      <description>PreambleIn this post, I will demonstrate how to use tools from the statnet collection of packages to simulate and model networks. The purpose of this post is to provide readers with tools that I wish I had when I first started using network analysis. I’m not an expert and I’m still learning how to use these tools well. But knowing they exist and how to use them will enable you to creatively study network processes and validate your prior knowledge of and conclusions about the networks that you study.</description>

      <description>Discussion ITo start our discussion, let’s to reflect on our current understandings of a network as a concept. In small groups, take a moment to discuss the following questions.
What is a network?
How would you describe a network in simple terms?
In our view, a network is a representation of a set(s) of relationships between one or more entities. The entities of interest to the SENG are usually social or ecological beings.</description>

      <description>Welcome to the Social Ecological Networks Group. For brevity, we use SENG (sen-jee) as a mnemonic that you’ll find throughout this website and our social media handles. SENG is a graduate student led working group that uses the network concept to think about and study social and ecological processes. You can learn more about us and our research interests by checking out the People tab.
We were motivated to create SENG for numerous reasons.</description>

      <description>The Social Ecological Networks Group (SENG) is graduate student led learning collective that uses the network concept to think about and study social and ecological problems. Our goal is to provide a space to collaborate and develop new ideas about complex social ecological networks.
We are happy you found us.
After all, this is a group about networks, and networks are formed through interactions just like the ones that led you here.</description>
