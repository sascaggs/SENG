      <description>The size of a network is determined by the number of vertices and edges within it, and different size networks have different structural properties. This is obviously true if social processes like homophily, preferential attachment, or triadic closure influence network size, but it is also true for randomly generated networks.
How do properties like density, sparseness, degree distribution, or connectivity change as the number of vertices in a network increases?</description>

      <description>Discussion ITo start our discussion, letâ€™s to reflect on our current understandings of a network as a concept. In small groups, take a moment to discuss the following questions.
What is a network?
How would you describe a network in simple terms?
In our view, a network is a representation of a set(s) of relationships between one or more entities. The entities of interest to the SENG are usually social or ecological beings.</description>
