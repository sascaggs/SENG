      <p>The Social Ecological Networks Group (SENG) is graduate student led learning collective that uses the network concept to think about and study social and ecological problems. Our goal is to provide a space to collaborate and develop new ideas about complex social ecological networks.</p>
<p><strong>We are happy you found us</strong>.</p>
<p>After all, this is a group about networks, and networks are formed through interactions just like the ones that led you here. One of the most amazing things about those interactions is that they exhibit patterns and behavior that change depending on the scale that you look at them from. Network patterns can be found in all kinds of social and ecological systems, at many different scales, and the network patterns we observe can provide clues about how systems function, what their histories might have been like, and what to expect in the future.</p>
<p>At SENG, we hold regular meetings on the 2nd and 4th Fridays of each month where we can discuss these complex network dynamics. In these meetings, we focus on <strong>network theory</strong> &ndash; the concepts and ideas that we can use to apply a network perspective to our research projects. We also hold meetings dedicated to understanding <strong>network analysis</strong>. In these meetings,  we learn to construct and analyze networks together in a casual learning community. In addition to these meetings, we have a Slack channel where we can discuss network topics, plan events, and stay connected.</p>
<p>If any of this sounds interesting to you, <a href="https://seng.netlify.app/contact/">send us a message</a> and get involved with SENG. If you&rsquo;d like to learn more about how SENG is structured and what our short and long term goals are, have a look at our first post, <a href="https://seng.netlify.app/2021/01/11/what-is-seng/">What is SENG?</a></p>
<p>Cheers!</p>
