      <description>Meeting InformationWelcome back network folx!
This semester, we will have 7 meetings. Something new we are doing this semester are Informal Workshops. In these workshops, we will meet in person to discuss our projects and work together to solve some of our analysis challenges. You can think of these workshops as a time to drop-in, say hello, and work collectively on our individual projects. We will keep a zoom room open as well so that our non-Columbus members can stop in and ask questions.</description>

      <title>(Re)Introduction to Networks in R</title>

      <description>In this meeting, we cover the basics of working with networks in R. By the end of the workshop, you will be acquainted with three packages – igraph, statnet, and tidygraph – and you will be able to create a network from scratch, turn it into a network object, create vertex and edge attributes, and genereate a basic visualization. Let’s get started.
R Markdown IntroductionBefore we begin talking about networks, let’s first talk about the R studio environment.</description>

      <title>Egocentric patterns in homophilous networks</title>
      <link>https://seng.netlify.app/meetings/complete-and-egocentric-networks/</link>

      <description>Introduction Researchers who work with smaller populations that have clearly defined boundaries (Laumann, Marsden, and Prensky 1989) may be able to design survey instruments that can feasibly document an entire social network. These complete, sociocentric networks can exhibit some systematic biases (Ready et al. 2020), but they typically do a better job of characterizing the full suite of direct and indirect connections within a population.
Many researchers, however, work in larger populations that have fuzzy boundaries, if any.</description>

      <title>Network Simulation using {statnet}</title>

      <description>PreambleIn this post, I will demonstrate how to use tools from the statnet collection of packages to simulate and model networks. The purpose of this post is to provide readers with tools that I wish I had when I first started using network analysis. I’m not an expert and I’m still learning how to use these tools well. But knowing they exist and how to use them will enable you to creatively study network processes and validate your prior knowledge of and conclusions about the networks that you study.</description>

      <description>Module 1: R Studio BasicsR is both a language and computing environment.R is open source and free for anyone to download and use.
PanelsThere are four visible panels at a time, each with different purposes(1) The R console accepts commands and produces output to your commands.(2) A text editor window to create and record code.(3) An environment window that shows your stored data in R(4) A plot/help/files window that can alternate to show your plots, help reauests, and file directory</description>

      <title>Foundations of the Network Perspective</title>

      <description>Discussion ITo start our discussion, let’s to reflect on our current understandings of a network as a concept. In small groups, take a moment to discuss the following questions.
What is a network?
How would you describe a network in simple terms?
In our view, a network is a representation of a set(s) of relationships between one or more entities. The entities of interest to the SENG are usually social or ecological beings.</description>
