      <description>Meeting InformationWelcome back network folx!
This semester, we will have 7 meetings. Something new we are doing this semester are Informal Workshops. In these workshops, we will meet in person to discuss our projects and work together to solve some of our analysis challenges. You can think of these workshops as a time to drop-in, say hello, and work collectively on our individual projects. We will keep a zoom room open as well so that our non-Columbus members can stop in and ask questions.</description>

      <description>Once a month, the Environmental Professionals Network (EPN) hosts network events over breakfast. The EPN is a service of the School of Environment and Natural Resources at Ohio State University that works to help connect and grow environmental professionals both in-person and online.
This month’s EPN event focuses on “Advancing environmental justice in extreme head and adapting through collaborative networks.” As part of this September 13th event, SENG members Kimberly Ordonez and Harrison Fried will present their work developing a “Network of Stakeholders” website tool that harnesses the power of network science to help bring together environmentally focused organizations and individuals.</description>
