      <description>Picture this: You’re working on project and you’ve just finished collecting all your network data. You’ve worked hard to get a complete network and you’re eager to start analyzing it. You power up your computer, load up Rstudio, and after lots of careful wrangling and tidying, you’re ready to plot the network. With great anticipation, you write a little code and WHAM! you get hit with a hot plate of spaghetti and meatballs.</description>

      <description>Data StructuresThe Square MatrixThe EdgelistBut Why?Bernouli Graph SimulationNetwork objects in igraphMatrix \(\rightarrow\) networkEdgelist \(\rightarrow\) networkVisualize igraph objectsNetwork objects in statnetVisualize network objectsReferencesIn this meeting, we cover the basics of working with networks in R. By the end of the workshop, you will be acquainted with three packages – igraph, statnet, and tidygraph – and you will be able to create a network from scratch, turn it into a network object, create vertex and edge attributes, and genereate a basic visualization.</description>
