      <description>PreambleIn this post, I will demonstrate how to use tools from the statnet collection of packages to simulate and model networks. The purpose of this post is to provide readers with tools that I wish I had when I first started using network analysis. I’m not an expert and I’m still learning how to use these tools well. But knowing they exist and how to use them will enable you to creatively study network processes and validate your prior knowledge of and conclusions about the networks that you study.</description>
