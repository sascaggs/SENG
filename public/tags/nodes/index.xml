      <description>Many networks that we find interesting are large and structurally complex. This makes them difficult to visually understand. And although coming up with ways to visualize such networks is a kind of fun, most of the time we need practical ways to describe the position and structure of complex networks without dealing with the tangled hairball.
This post covers some a variety of ways to measure network position and structure.</description>

      <title>Network size and structure</title>

      <description>The size of a network is determined by the number of vertices and edges within it, and different size networks have different structural properties. This is obviously true if social processes like homophily, preferential attachment, or triadic closure influence network size, but it is also true for randomly generated networks.
How do properties like density, sparseness, degree distribution, or connectivity change as the number of vertices in a network increases?</description>

      <description>Data StructuresThe Square MatrixThe EdgelistBut Why?Bernouli Graph SimulationNetwork objects in igraphMatrix \(\rightarrow\) networkEdgelist \(\rightarrow\) networkVisualize igraph objectsNetwork objects in statnetVisualize network objectsReferencesIn this meeting, we cover the basics of working with networks in R. By the end of the workshop, you will be acquainted with three packages – igraph, statnet, and tidygraph – and you will be able to create a network from scratch, turn it into a network object, create vertex and edge attributes, and genereate a basic visualization.</description>

      <title>Foundations of the Network Perspective</title>

      <description>Discussion ITo start our discussion, let’s to reflect on our current understandings of a network as a concept. In small groups, take a moment to discuss the following questions.
What is a network?
How would you describe a network in simple terms?
In our view, a network is a representation of a set(s) of relationships between one or more entities. The entities of interest to the SENG are usually social or ecological beings.</description>
